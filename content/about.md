Hello my name is Trevor (Treasure on Discord), I study often and take a lot of notes while doing it. This blog with automatic pagination, indexing and tagging is a great way to share what I am working on with others. I cover a fairly wide range of topics relating to technology, so the tags help narrow down posts to topical groupings.
