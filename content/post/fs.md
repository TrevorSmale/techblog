## Key Concepts / Glossary üîë
### Snapshots üì∏
- **Snapshots** are read-only copies of a file system at a specific point in time, allowing users to save the state of the file system for backup and recovery purposes. They are efficient and consume minimal space, as only the differences between the current state and the snapshot are stored.
### Clones vs. Snapshots üì∏üß¨
- **Snapshots**: Read-only copies of the file system at a specific time.
- **Clones**: Writable copies of snapshots that can be modified independently.
### RAID-Z Levels ‚õìÔ∏è
- **RAID-Z1**: Single parity; can tolerate the loss of one disk.
- **RAID-Z2**: Double parity; can tolerate the loss of two disks.
- **RAID-Z3**: Triple parity; can tolerate the loss of three disks.
### RAID 5 and RAID 6 ‚õìÔ∏è
- **RAID 5**: Stripes data across disks with single parity; can tolerate the loss of one disk.
- **RAID 6**: Stripes data across disks with double parity; can tolerate the loss of two disks.
### Issues with RAID 5/6 in Btrfs
Btrfs's implementation of RAID 5/6 is considered unstable due to issues like the write hole problem, making it less reliable for production use. Data integrity may be compromised, leading to potential data loss.
### CDDL License ü™™
The **Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)** is an open-source license created by Sun Microsystems. It is incompatible with the GPL, which can complicate integration with Linux.
### Btrfs Self-Healing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
**Self-Healing** in Btrfs works by verifying data against checksums and repairing any detected corruption using redundant data stored on other disks in a RAID configuration.
### Dynamic Storage üß±
**Dynamic Storage** refers to the ability to manage multiple storage devices within a single file system, allowing for on-the-fly addition and removal of devices, with the file system automatically balancing data across them.
### Online Resizing üó∫Ô∏è
**Online Resizing** allows the resizing of a file system while it is mounted and in use. XFS supports growing the file system online, while Btrfs supports both growing and shrinking.
### B-Trees ‚öñÔ∏è
A **B-tree** is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. B-trees are used in file systems like Btrfs to manage metadata and data blocks.
### Extent Base Allocation üë†
is a method used by modern file systems to manage data storage efficiently. Instead of tracking individual fixed-size blocks, the file system groups contiguous blocks into larger units called extents.
### Persistent Pre-allocation üéüÔ∏è
This technique reserves a specific amount of disk space for a file in advance, ensuring that the allocated space remains available, which helps in reducing fragmentation and guaranteeing storage for large files.
### Delayed Allocation ‚è±Ô∏è
Delayed allocation defers the assignment of specific disk blocks to file data until the data is flushed to disk, optimizing the allocation process and reducing fragmentation by allowing the file system to make better decisions about where to place data.
### Multi-block Allocation ‚ãî
Multi-block allocation allows a file system to allocate multiple contiguous blocks at once, rather than individually, improving performance and reducing fragmentation, especially for large files.
### Stripe-aware Allocation üß†
Stripe-aware allocation is used in RAID configurations to ensure that data is distributed evenly across all disks in the array, optimizing performance by aligning data placement with the underlying stripe size of the RAID setup.
### Fine-Grained Locking (for SMP Scalability) üöÄ
Fine-grained locking applies locks at a granular level, allowing multiple processors to concurrently access different parts of the file system, enhancing performance and scalability in multi-core environments.
### RAID 1+0 üñáÔ∏è
RAID support includes configurations such as RAID 1 for data mirroring and RAID 1+0 for combining mirroring with striping to provide both redundancy and improved performance.
### Thin Provisioning üîÆ
Thin provisioning allocates disk space on-demand rather than reserving it all upfront, optimizing storage utilization by only using the space actually required by data.
### Asynchronous Bulk-Freeing üóëÔ∏è
Asynchronous bulk-freeing performs large-scale space reclamation in the background, allowing the file system to manage deletions efficiently without impacting overall performance.
### Large Directory Support üè¢
Large directory support enables efficient management of directories with a vast number of entries, using optimized data structures to ensure fast performance for directory operations.
