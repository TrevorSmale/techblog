# Intro üëã

A progress update regarding the ProLUG website that improve useability

---

## Info Pop-up

I wanted to add additional information to the site while maintaining a clean layout, predictable and comprehensible design. This is not only my personal aesthetic taste, this is a feature of accessibility. Websites with tons of information, many levels of contrast and or layouts are not only difficult for the visually impaired, but confusing for people suffering from cognitive impairment. I try to use inclusive design in accordance with WCAG guidelines on any project I am working on. So this leads me to the objective, to create a pop up design with additional information. I started with one of the more confusing features of the site, the verification input. When getting started, I wasn't sure if it would be possible to accomplish this with TailwindCSS, so it took a bit of reading to confirm. It turns out this is completely possible using tailwind as evidence by the code snippet.

## Design Details 
I would like to convey about the design choices as 

- Simple prominent button with high contrast.
- Semi transparent background to denote this is a temporary overlay
- Large text 
- Short, straightforward descriptions
- Differing colors for open and close to further indicate the state.
