# Warewulf 

Warewulf is an open source stateless provisioning and management software. 

### Stateless

Stateless node management refers to the practice of managing compute nodes in such a way that they **do not** retain persistent state information between sessions or reboots. Instead of keeping configurations, applications, or data locally on each node, everything needed for the node to function is either stored centrally or recreated each time the node boots up.

### Data Persistence

Because Warewulf is Stateless, data must be stored outside the provisioned machines as they are ephemeral. So keep in mind that you will have to implement a centralized storage server to hydrate clusters once they are provisioned.

### Ephemeral 

Warewulf builds nodes from a centralized schema / database containing explicit information about each node to be built. It is of no consequence to rebuild the entire infrastructure, something that is often done.

### Bare Metal

Unlike Kubernetes, warewulf builds stateless nodes on bare-metal. Warewulf nodes take full advanced of available hardware, something that is favorable for high performance computing

### Lets GO!

Warewulf is almost entirely written in GO. So you best believe it is fast and lightweight.

### History

Warewulf originated in the early 2000s as an open-source tool designed to simplify the deployment and management of High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. It was initially developed to create stateless cluster nodes, providing a scalable and efficient approach for large-scale environments. Over time, Warewulf became a widely adopted solution in the HPC community for provisioning consistent and rapid boot environments, evolving to support modern clusters and hybrid computing models.

### Ansible Flavouring

Ansible can be used to deeply configure provisioned nodes, just like it can be used for almost anything these days. Ansible and associated playbooks can be paired with a warewulf config to build and configure massive infrastructure in a single shot, mind you with lots of preliminary work.
