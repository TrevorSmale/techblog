## Intro üëã

For the ProLUG Linux Security Course there is a Capstone project. During the 1st week of the course, I started using STIG's. This was a very frustrating task as DISA Stig Viewer is not a very good piece of software that is somewhat difficult to install outside of windows. Getting Stig Viewer installed on Nix OS was especially annoying. This lead me to research alternatives and to my surprise there were very few. After a discussion with a fellow classmate, it became apparent that I could possibly create a nice browser based tool using GO. 

This lead to some research and LLM prompting to field the project and figure out if it was doable and how much effort would be involved in the scope. It turned out that STIG's are a special form of XML called Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format `XCCDF`
