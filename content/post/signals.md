# Signals üö•

In Unix-like operating systems, a signal is a limited form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred. Signals are used to interrupt a process and convey a message (like an alert), often in response to hardware or software events. Each signal has a unique number and symbolic name, and they can be sent by the kernel, another process, or the user.

Signals operate at a relatively low level within the operating system, but they are not the lowest level of communication or control.

Interrupts: Even lower-level than signals, these are triggered by hardware devices to notify the CPU of events (e.g., disk I/O completion).
