### Intro 👋

To complete this course, we are required to undertake a capstone project. Before the course began, I created a graphic design and branding package for ProLUG, as I felt the group was gaining critical mass but lacked visual cohesion. As part of that package, I designed a certificate template for use in this course, which included the suggestion of a verification link. I have received several certifications from the Linux Professional Institute, all of which include a verification link to a server hosted by the organization. I believe this feature is crucial in a world of diploma mills and AI-generated credentials, as it ensures that those who put in real work are properly accredited.

### Locking in a project 🔒

The night before the course started, I reached out to Scott to ensure he had everything he needed in terms of graphics and to let him know that I was available for further support if required. During our conversation, I mentioned the idea of a verification link and server, which led to my proposing it as a project. His response was, "possibly." The next day, while teaching, Scott announced that a student would be creating a verification server for the certificates, so I guess the project is green-lit! 🤣

### Preface 🤨

I’d like to preface this by stating that I have limited programming experience. This project is beyond my current understanding, and I’ll need to break everything down into bite-sized pieces to fully grasp it. So, follow me on my journey to creating a verification server.

### Outline of the Project 🧭

The project involves creating a system that, when given a unique ID, returns information matching what is written on the certificate. For each certificate issued, we need to generate a unique ID and link that directs to the corresponding credentials.

### My initial simple plan/outline 

### 1. Creating the data

Intake the first name, last name and date to create a unique hash. 

### 2. Storing the data

this info is then added to columns in a database.

### 3. Retrieving the data

With the use of an API and Web Interface, we can use the hash to prompt for more data.

### Initial Tech Stack 🤔

Data Generation: GO
Database: SQLight
Interface: HTML, CSS, JS

### Next Steps... 🥾

1. I plan on discussing this in the Code Cove group in ProLUG
2. I plan on researching how LPI has created their verification server
3. I plan on creating comprehensive build notes in LogSeq/here
