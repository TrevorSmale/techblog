### Intro 👋

I am a member of a fantastic group called the Professional Linux User Group lead by Scott Champine. The home base is on Discord where over 2000 people discuss Linux daily.
Scott and other members teach via Live-Streaming and Interactive Labs with supporting documentation. Scott has created a 16 week deep dive course into linux adminstration starting September 14th that I have gladly enrolled in.
This course will take place every Saturday via a livestream with interactive Q/A wherein participants leave with assignments. This blog is in part, related to the course as I will document my learning among other things.
