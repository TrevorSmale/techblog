# Intro 👋

To complete the Professional Linux User Group (ProLUG) Professional Administrator Course (PAC), we are required to submit a final Capstone Project.

This article is a bit out of order, as I proactively chose a project topic before it was formally introduced. The purpose of this article is to document the project requirements as set out by our instructor.
