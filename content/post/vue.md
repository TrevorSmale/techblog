### Intro

I frequent a Discord group called ProLUG (Professional Linux User Group). The group is organized around cooperative, project-based learning, led by experienced members. One of these groups, called Coding Cove, is led by Ryan Long (SaltyCatfish). Ryan is a very experienced and senior developer who introduces us to new concepts on a weekly basis.

### Vue

This past weekend, Ryan introduced Vue.js and the ideas behind the framework. We spent over an hour discussing and interacting with Vue, and I came away from the meeting excited to learn more and start building projects.

### Why Vue is Exciting

What I really liked about Vue is the concept of templates and components. These ideas seemed logical from the start. Templates can be created and reused on multiple pages, while components provide modularity. Together, these features result in a very clean and easy-to-read codebase, especially for larger projects.

### What I Was Using

Prior to learning about Vue, I had completed a few projects using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React. While I’m a big fan of Go (for reasons I won’t get into here), I found React to be cumbersome. React often creates messy code, especially when combined with Tailwind.

### Go + Vue?

After the meeting, I felt inspired to explore combining the power of Go with Vue. I started searching for examples, and it’s definitely doable for simple or small projects. However, when I looked at more advanced projects, the situation became complicated. Gluing a Go backend to a Vue frontend felt relatively simple at first, but when you introduce middleware, SSR/CSR, OAuth2, and more, things quickly become complex.

### Then I Found Nuxt

Nuxt is a "batteries-included" framework built on top of Vue. It comes with all the modern build tools and services needed for a professional project, and everything ties together elegantly.

### Where I Am Now

I’ve done a deep dive into Nuxt, and it feels very comfortable to work with. After purchasing a course on Udemy, I’ve completed a few simple projects and intend to build a mid-level project soon. With Vue’s templating and components, along with Tailwind’s efficiency, I’m confident I can create a functional and aesthetically pleasing project that runs efficiently across different systems.
