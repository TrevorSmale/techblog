# Where to start

I am a generally curious person who enjoys learning new things. However, the shear volume of information available can lead to feeling overwhelmed, distracted and aimless.
From years of experience being an auto-didact, I have honed my craft of self directed study. Now, I create a solid learning plan that keeps me on track and feeling a sense of achievement.
A learning plan is a personal roadmap that outlines what to learn, how to learn it and when to reach certain milestones. I start with goals and work my way backwards from there. 

# 2025

If I am to state my purpose simply
Will be the year I:

- Get advanced with GO programming by writing several useful programs.
- Learn Kubernenets and prove that knowledge with a Certification
- Get comfy with Ansible
- Get JLPT N5 Certified in Japanese Language
