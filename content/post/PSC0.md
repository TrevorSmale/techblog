# Intro üëã

I've just started a new **Security Engineering** course created by Scott Champine through ProLUG. As a graduate of his **Linux Administration** course and an active contributor to the **Professional Linux User Group**, I felt compelled to make time for this new course‚ÄîI've learned a great deal from his teachings in the past.

## The Course

This is a deep dive into **Enterprise Operational Security**. That includes topics like **compliance**, **threat management**, and **system integrity**. I'm also helping coordinate and develop a **web-book** to accompany the course.[^1]

While I already hold several cybersecurity certifications that cover conceptual frameworks and best practices, this course goes much deeper with **hands-on labs**. We harden systems with **STIGs**,[^2] monitor and detect activity on live systems, and troubleshoot compliance issues.

The course spans **10 weeks**, with an estimated **100 hours** of work to complete the weekly projects and the capstone.
