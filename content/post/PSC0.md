# Intro üëã

I just started a new Security Engineering course created by Scott Champine in ProLUG. As a graduate of his Linux Administration course and deeply involved contributor to the Professional Linux User Group, I felt compelled to fit this course into my schedule as I have learned a great deal from his teachings in the past.

## The Course

Is a deep dive into Enterprise Operational Security. This means Compliance, Threat Management and System Integrity. I have been involved with coordinating and developing a web-book for this course[^1]
I have already received several cyber security certifications that deal with conceptual frameworks and best practices. However, this course goes very deep with hands on labs wherein we harden systems with STIGS[^2] Monitor and Detect activity on running systems and troubleshooting mal compliance issues.

The duration of the course is 10 weeks with an apoximated 100 hours of work required to complete weekly projects as well as a capstone.
