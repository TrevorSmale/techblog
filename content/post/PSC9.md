## Intro üëã

In this Unit we look at how Certificates and Keys go beyond Asymmetric encryption with Public / Private. We look at how multiple checks and multiple layers of trust must be used in this mad mad world. [^1]

---

## Worksheet

`Question`

How do these topics align with what you already know about system security?

`Answer`

Well I had felt like I had a clear picture of `Symmetric` and `Asymmetric` encryption modalities. Furthermore, I had a strong prior understanding of `x.509` and `SSH` where Asymmetric encryption is used. Moreover, the procedure of generating Private and subsequent public keys. However, the verbosity and complexity of the required reading has me scratching my head and looking at more sophisticated modality of key generation and exchange eg. `TLS 1.2, 1.3`

`Question`

Were any of the terms or concepts new to you?

`Answer`

`key-transport and/or key-agreement protocols` - a method of establishing a shared secret key between two or more parties 
where one party creates the key and securely delivers it to the others.

`Challenge Values` - dynamic, randomly generated numbers or strings used to initiate authentication.

`nonce` - a unique, random or pseudo-random number used to ensure the security and integrity of data transmitted over a network.

`Question`

What are the three subprotocols of TLS?

`Answer`

`The handshake`  used to negotiate the session parameters.

`Change cipher spec` used in TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 to change the cryptographic parameters of a session.

`Alert protocols`  used to notify the other party of an error condition.

`Question`

How does TLS apply to:
Confidentiality
Integrity
Authentication
Anti-replay

`Answer`

`Confidentiality`

Confidentiality is provided for a communication session by the negotiated encryption algorithm
for the cipher suite and the encryption keys derived from the master secret and random values.

`Integrity`

TLS uses a cipher suite of algorithms and functions, including key establishment, digital signature, confidentiality, and integrity algorithms. In TLS 1.3, the master secret is derived by iteratively invoking an extract-then-expand function with previously derived secrets, used by the negotiated security services to protect the data exchanged between the client and the serve. In TLS 1.3, only AEAD symmetric algorithms are used for confidentiality and integrity.

`Authentication`

Server authentication is performed by the client using the server‚Äôs public-key certificate, which
the server presents during the handshake.

`Anti-Replay`

in TLS 1.3 The integrity-protected envelope of the message contains a monotonically increasing sequence number. Once the message integrity is verified, the sequence number of the current message is compared with the sequence number of the previous message.

### Definitions

- `TLS` (Transport Layer Security) A protocol that encrypts data in transit to ensure privacy and integrity.
- `Symmetric Keys` A cryptographic method where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- `Asymmetric Keys` A method using a public/private key pair where one key encrypts and the other decrypts.
- `Non-Repudiation` A guarantee that a sender cannot deny the authenticity of their message or signature.
- `Anti-Replay` A mechanism that prevents attackers from reusing valid data packets to mimic legitimate transactions.
- `Plaintext` Data in a readable and unencrypted format.
- `Cyphertext` Data that has been encrypted and is unreadable without the correct decryption key.
- `Fingerprints` Short unique representations (hashes) of public keys used to verify their authenticity.
- `Passphrase (in key generation)` A user-supplied string that encrypts private keys to protect them from unauthorized access.

`Reading`

- Review Solving the Bottom Turtle[^5]

`Question`

- Does the diagram on page 44 make sense to you for what you did with a certificate authority in this lab?

`Answer`

- Yes it does, we had only setup a portion of this chain of trust, yet it got the idea across of whom we are referring to and how we build a certificate from that referral.

`Assignment`

- Complete the lab: https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/212-public-private-keys-with-ssh

`Question`

- What is the significance of the permission settings that you saw on the generated public and private key pairs?

`Answer`

- Only the owner has Read/Write permission to the Private key, whereas the public key -- meant to be shared, is Readable by Group and Others.
