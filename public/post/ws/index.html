<h3 id="intro">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/ws/#intro">Intro</a>
</h3>
<p>This blog will likely be dominated by Linux talk as that is what I spend most of my time with. However, I do full-stack web development on occlusion.
In fact, I have worked as a professional web Designer/Developer on and off, doing simple full stack projects in a range of languages. Recently, I have been stepping up my game with the intention of creating web applications with great GUIs, not only information pages. I think that with mature Javascript frameworks like NextJS or React and WASM (Web Assembly), we are going to see high performance desktop applications transition to being web-apps. This potential has me excited about learning more sophisticated tools.</p>



<h3 id="go">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/ws/#go">GO</a>
</h3>
<p>Golang is a dead simple systems focused language created by GOATED Unix contributors. When I started picking up Go a few years back, it was not really popular. Web development was dominated by NodeJS on the backend and there were no job posting for the skill. However, I tend to have good instincts and decided to eschew Node in favor of GO. I am very happy with this decision as it is clear, strongly typed, easy to set up and fast as hell.
You can classify me as a GO enjoyer and back-ned deployer. GO now has a built-in HTTPs service and muxer, so it is my go-to for serving static and dynamic content.</p>



<h3 id="tailwind">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/ws/#tailwind">TailWind</a>
</h3>
<p>I really regret not checking out TailWind CSS earlier, it is so nice. I totally had the wrong idea and thought that it was just another annoying framework that over complicates and I was sorely wrong. It really helps in combination with GO templates to create beautiful responsive layouts. There is not much too a simple TW setup, just a simple call-out in the header. When things needs to be more expansive, one can use a config file to specify rules.
I think I will be using a lot more TW in the future.</p>



<h3 id="react">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/ws/#react">React</a>
</h3>
<p>I am not a major fan of JS because I am a fan of simplicity, alas it is the language of the Web, so I must tango with wild syntax. Most web experiences  require reactive interaction and content delivery. I am not locked into react as there are so many similar frameworks, but I am saying it is a must in ones stack.</p>



<h3 id="vscode">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/ws/#vscode">VSCode</a>
</h3>
<p>Having a customizable proper IDE is important for getting things done. As much as I like learning Vim, Helix, or even Sublime, I know that no-matter the level of configuration it wont even come close to a proper IDE that lints, detects bugs, has a large ecosystem of plug-ins and comfy features like workspaces and built in problem console. If you just want to make stuff, then reduce your cognitive overhead and utilize a user friendly IDE.</p>
