</h1>
<p>The overarching theme of this Unit is in the title, we are looking at Managing Users &amp; Groups. Managing users and groups in Linux within an enterprise involves creating, modifying, and organizing user accounts and permissions to enforce security and control over resources.</p>
<p>Organizing permissions to enforce security is more important than it has ever been, as we live in a hyper connected world with many bad actors and large amounts of sensitive data.</p>
<p>Linux is fundamentally well suited for Managing Users &amp; Groups because permissions permeate every aspect of a Linux environment. Everything is a file and every file has associated permissions, Therefore we have granular control over the comings and goings of users as administrators.</p>

<p>Het&rsquo; server is unique to me. He uses an injest system that makes a jump to the actual server for security purposes. Within the main server we have a warewulf managed cluster running a series of Rocky Linux VM&rsquo;s. ⛰</p>
<p>Since we will be doing this from one of the Rocky Nodes within the system, the jump server will not be an issue I recon. 🤔</p>

<p>So I shouldn&rsquo;t just pop into the server and go willy nilly with scanning commands. This sever is managed by someone who understands security. So it is best to do some <strong>Dead Reckoning</strong> beforehand.</p>

  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#the-basic-commands-">The Basic Commands ⌨️</a>
</h4>
<p>Mapping the remote servers open ports with nmap.
nmap stands for Network Mapper. A quick perusal of the man page states it is an exploration tool and security / port scanner. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts
are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.</p>
<p>In order to Map the network I am going to use the ip address for the argument/target of the nmap command.</p>
<pre><code>nmap &lt;server-ip&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Checking mounted filesystem&rsquo; with df. stands for <strong>Display Free</strong> disk space. It is a utility that displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified mounted file system or on the file system of which file is a past.</p>
<p>I will be using the -h flag for human readable format, which ads unit suffixes eg. Gibibyte (GiB) to the ends of values. There is more to it, but I am mentioning the bread and butter of the flag.</p>
<pre><code>df -h
</code></pre>

  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#getting-to-know-nmap-">Getting to know nmap 🫶</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>nmap</strong> is actually a big command, by big I mean the number of options and capabilities are vast. It is quite popular with pen testers and is packaged with Kali Linux &ndash; a security analysis and exploitation focused distribution of Linux, so best believe it is something important. This essentially means I should take some time to get to know it more.</p>



<h4 id="stealth-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#stealth-">Stealth 🥷</a>
</h4>
<p>Beware that <strong>nmap</strong> can and will trigger detection software like an active firewall, because <strong>nmap</strong> is conducting <strong>Funny Bizniz</strong> by way of packet <strong>trickery</strong> inside a network, both are technical terms. Luckily there is a <strong>stealth</strong> option ( -s ) that enables the mapping to take place un-detected &ndash;for the most part.</p>
<p>Contrary to what I assumed, the lower case <strong>s</strong> does not even stand for stealth, though it still helps as a mnemonic. No, it actually stands for SYN and
SYN stands for Synchronize. It is part of the TCP three-way handshake, which is a process used to establish a reliable connection between two devices on a network and has nothing to do with guys meeting at a bar.</p>
<p>I thought we were trying to be stealthy, not synchronized 🤔
Well is actually a form of <strong>Funny Bizniz</strong> wherein SYN is sent and never acknowledged, thustly not completing the handshake process and therefore hiding activity <strong>somehow</strong></p>
<p>but <strong>how?</strong> Well&hellip; it reduces the chance of being logged by the target system’s monitoring tools, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems. Now we both know.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is only one command option, just imagine how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>

  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#-accessing-the-secure-jump-point">🚀 Accessing the Secure Jump Point</a>
</h3>
<p>The network is safely tucked behind a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) running on an Asus Router. This setup allows access from a WAN, in this case, <em>The Internet</em> (if you’ve heard of it 🌐). It securely gate-keeps the network via login credentials, because let’s be honest, the Internet can be a scary place with bots&hellip; and sometimes people 👀.</p>
<p>So, what exactly does DDNS do? Well, I’m glad you asked! Most home internet connections don’t offer a static IP address, which makes hosting things tricky because the IP will randomly change. The IP is dynamic for a few reasons, including cost savings and the limited availability of IPv4 addresses. Anyway, I’m getting off track 🛤️. A DDNS monitors this dynamic IP and links it to a stable address that stays fixed.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: DDNS bonds a dynamic IP with a fixed address, offering the added bonus of hiding the internal IP from bad actors, or as I like to call them, <em>the baddies</em> in London 🕵️‍♂️. So, this network has a DDNS gateway in place for that extra layer of security 🔒.</p>

<p>Once a credentialed fellow enters their login while hanging at the gateway, a list of servers appears, like a digital menu 🍽️. From this list, one can choose where to jump to. In my case, I leapt to <em>Rocky12</em>, a node within a managed cluster. I knew a little about this network thanks to earlier sessions, but most of this can also be discovered by doing some network scanning 🕵️.</p>

<p>I quickly identified the <em>warewulf orchestration device</em> and all of the <em>Rocky nodes</em>. However, a few mysterious devices needed some detective work 🔎. I noticed <strong>glrpc</strong> listed as a service while scanning six addresses—three on one IP range and three on another. A quick Google search revealed that <strong>glrpc</strong> relates to <em>GlusterFS</em>, a filesystem specific to Red Hat systems. After watching a video explainer on GlusterFS, I figured out that these two IP ranges were likely a RAID or high availability configuration 💾.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lateral Movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Lateral movement in the context of cyber exploitation refers to an attacker’s strategy of moving across a network to gain access to additional systems or sensitive data after initially infiltrating a single point. This involves leveraging compromised credentials, escalating privileges, or exploiting vulnerabilities to navigate between hosts and systems. The objective is often to broaden access within the environment while avoiding detection, eventually targeting critical infrastructure or data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exfiltration 🧳🚀</li>
</ul>
<p>refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a target system or network to an external location controlled by an attacker. This can involve methods such as encrypted tunnels, covert channels, or compromised accounts to avoid detection. Exfiltration is typically the final step in a cyberattack, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, intellectual property, or credentials for further malicious activities.</p>

<h4 id="footprinting-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#footprinting-">Footprinting 👣</a>
</h4>
<p>Footprinting is an essential phase in ethical hacking and system security. It involves gathering information about a computer system, network, or organization to understand its structure and identify potential vulnerabilities. Footprinting is often the first step of a cyberattack or penetration test, allowing attackers or security professionals to map out an environment before deciding how to approach the next steps.</p>



<h4 id="scanning-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#scanning-">Scanning 🔍</a>
</h4>
<p>Scanning is a process of actively probing systems or networks to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. It&rsquo;s used by attackers to gather deeper insights for potential exploitation and by security professionals to assess weaknesses. Common tools include Nmap and Nessus, while defenses include firewalls and IDS/IPS systems.</p>



<h4 id="enumeration-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#enumeration-">Enumeration 💯</a>
</h4>
<p>Enumeration is the process of extracting more detailed information about a target, such as usernames, network shares, and system services, after identifying open ports and active systems. It typically involves active engagement with the target to gain in-depth knowledge that can be used for exploitation.</p>



<h4 id="system-hacking-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#system-hacking-">System Hacking 🪓</a>
</h4>
<p>System hacking is the process of gaining unauthorized access to individual systems or networks by exploiting vulnerabilities. It involves activities such as password cracking, privilege escalation, installing backdoors, and covering tracks. Ethical hackers use these techniques to assess system security and recommend protective measures.</p>



<h4 id="escalation-of-privilege-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#escalation-of-privilege-">Escalation of Privilege 🥉🥈🥇</a>
</h4>
<p>Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher-level permissions or privileges than initially granted, allowing an attacker to execute commands with elevated authority. This can be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, leading to unauthorized access to restricted resources or system control.</p>



<h4 id="rule-of-least-privilege-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#rule-of-least-privilege-">Rule of least privilege 🔐</a>
</h4>
<p>The Rule of Least Privilege (LoP) is a security principle that states users, applications, and systems should only be granted the minimum level of access or permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This helps reduce the attack surface, limit potential damage from breaches, and mitigate insider threats.</p>



<h4 id="covering-tracks-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#covering-tracks-">Covering Tracks 🧹👣</a>
</h4>
<p>Covering tracks is the process attackers use to hide their unauthorized activities and avoid detection. This involves techniques such as deleting or modifying system logs, using rootkits, and clearing command histories to prevent system administrators or security teams from discovering their presence or actions.</p>



<h4 id="planting-backdoors-">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/techblog/post/pacu5/#planting-backdoors-">Planting Backdoors 🪴🚪</a>
</h4>
<p>Planting backdoors involves installing hidden access points in a system, allowing attackers to bypass regular authentication and gain unauthorized access at a later time. Backdoors can be inserted through malicious code, vulnerabilities, or modifications to existing software, making them useful for maintaining persistent control over compromised systems.</p>
